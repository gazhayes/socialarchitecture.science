Let's do a thought experiment. Jump into your imaginary time machine and head on over to the year 2000.

You're tasked with ensuring Encyclopaedia Britannica's dominance over Wikipedia by _becoming_ Wikipedia. There's still a year before Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger are set to register wikipedia.org. Britannica has a full year head-start. They substantial resources and a huge market share along with a brand that has lasted since 1768. This should be a very easy task. All you need to do is convince the CEO of Encyclopaedia Britannica to fire all the expert contributors (including 110 Nobel prize winners, 5 former US presidents, and 4000 expert contributors) and simply let _anyone_ edit it instead.

You'll have just as much trouble _today_ trying to convince the gatekeepers (and contributors) of existing open source projects - especially cryptocurrencies - to adopt the software development equivalent of the Wikipedia model. 

This is not surprising however, and it's unfair to criticise people for not entering the unknown. The environment that Monero is being developed in is the closest I've found to the Wikipedia model. It's the most friendly and open of all cryptocurrency communities. The developers and researchers are at the top of their field, and they are also amazing and friendly people at the same time. It's impossible not to have the utmost respect for them. Monero is the _closest_ any cryptocurrency has come to using the Wikipedia model, but at the same time it's a not even in the same galaxy.

Imagine you're a 'gatekeeper' at Monero. there are _serious_ consequences for rocking the boat and messing things up. Things are working right now. Research is getting done, they are pushing the envelope in terms of privacy and security. They are coming up with quite genius solutions to blockchain bloat. Things really are working very well. If they tried to (truly) adopt the C4 things could very well go wrong, and very quickly. Not only that, but with so many people having their money involved, the personal consequences for the the developers, should they be deemed responsible for anything going wrong, would be disastrous.  People would be out for blood. Criticising people with that kind of burden on their shoulders for not
