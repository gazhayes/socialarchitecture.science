Let's do a thought experiment. Jump into your imaginary time machine and head on over to the year 2000.

You're tasked with ensuring Encyclopaedia Britannica's dominance over Wikipedia by _becoming_ Wikipedia. There's still a year before Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger are set to register wikipedia.org. Britannica has a full year head-start. They substantial resources and a huge market share along with a brand that has lasted since 1768. This should be a very easy task. All you need to do is convince the CEO of Encyclopaedia Britannica to fire all the expert contributors (including 110 Nobel prize winners, 5 former US presidents, and 4000 expert contributors) and simply let _anyone_ edit it instead.

You'll have just as much trouble _today_ trying to convince the gatekeepers (and contributors) of existing open source projects - especially cryptocurrencies - to adopt the software development equivalent of the Wikipedia model. This is not surprising however, and it's unfair to criticise people for not entering the unknown. If you're a 'gatekeeper' at Monero (they are actually wonderful people and I have the utmost respect for them), there are _serious_ consequences for messing this up, probably _more_ serious than for the CEO of Encyclopaedia Britannica taking a massive risk and sinking the company in 2000.
