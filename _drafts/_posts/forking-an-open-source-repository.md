Let's do a thought experiment. Jump into your imaginary time machine and head on over to the year 2000 - one year 

You're tasked with ensuring Encyclopaedia Britannica's dominance over Wikipedia by _becoming_ Wikipedia. There's still a year before Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger are set to register wikipedia.org, with a full year head-start over them and with a very large existing market share - not to mention a brand that has lasted since 1768 - this should be a very easy task. All you need to do is convince the CEO to fire all the expert contributors (including 110 Nobel prize winners, 5 former US presidents, and 4000 expert contributors) and simply let _anyone_ edit it instead.
