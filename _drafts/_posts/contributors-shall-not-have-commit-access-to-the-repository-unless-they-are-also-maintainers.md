Rule 2.1.7 of the C4 states that:

**_Contributors SHALL NOT have commit access to the repository unless they are also Maintainers._**

As [this issue](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/153) from 4 years ago states, contributors to a repository cannot self-assign issues or apply labels to issues unless they have full commit access to the repository.

My first thought was "_this is stupid, let's just fork github itself and put it under the C4 so that developers actually get the platform they want_". Guess you have to pick your battles though.
