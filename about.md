Blockrazor is an experiment in social architecture.

The idea is to end up with a complete database of everything anyone needs to know about any cryptocurrency, and make it dead easy for anyone to find the data they're looking for.

An example could be something like "_show me promising cryptocurrencies that are truely fungible and not yet listed on an exchange, an additional requirement is that I can mine it right now with my RX470 graphics card_".

**This provides us with a few key minimum requirements:**

1. Data gathering must be decentralized. There's no possible way for this level of pervasive and granular data collection to be done in a centralized manner.
2. Only the users themselves know what data is valuable to them. The best way to ensure that users get what they want is to completely remove the gap between users and developers. Users _are_ developers, developers are users.
3. The application itself must grow through an evolutionary process and not through central planning/intelligent design. This is the only robust way to reliably fill new niches.
