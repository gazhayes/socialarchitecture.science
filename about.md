I originally created this blog to document experiments in Social Architecture at Blockrazor. 

The idea behind Blockrazor is to end up with a _complete_ data set containing all possible information that any investor needs to know about any blockchain project. This is a very broad statement and multiple layers of data gathering and analysis are implied.

An example could be something like "_show me promising cryptocurrencies that are truely fungible and not yet listed on an exchange, an additional requirement is that I can mine it right now with my RX470 graphics card_", or "_show me projects with less than $100k of funding that have built a prototype and are now looking for more money_".

**This provides us with a couple of minimum requirements:**

1. Conway's law and Amdahl's law suggest that data gathering must be decentralized at the userspace level. There's no possible way for this level of pervasive and granular data collection to be done in a centralized manner.
2. Only the users themselves know what data is valuable to them. The best way to ensure that users get what they want is to completely remove the gap between users and developers. Users _are_ developers, developers are users. The development process must therefor also be decentralized and leaderless. The only logical conclusion I can see from this is that development must follow an evolutionary approach and not have any top-down planning or upfront consensus.
