Getting incentives right is very difficult, and maybe it's tall poppy syndrome kicking in but one feels a pang of unearned privilege when trying to create them.

Nevertheless, I decided to offer a monetary reward in appreciation of the best contributor of the fortnight at Blockrazor.

**Hypothesis:**

Offering a reward for the contributor who best follows the C4 and other contributor guidelines should increase the overall effort that contributors put into following these processes. There is also a pretty good chance that this will cause resentment in contributors who have a generally negative disposition to start with (I can't win, the game is rigged, the world is unfair, those grapes are probably sour anyway).

**Evaluation:**

The following metrics will be taken into account for a before and after comparison:

* Ratio of C4 compliant to non-compliant pull requests,
* Amount of (codebase) commenting in commits,
* Correct housekeeping vs lazy or incorrect housekeeping (claiming issues before working on them, not claiming more than one issue at once, closing resolved issues, commenting when an issue is complete and ready to be tested),
* How often tests are written for commits,
* How often people help out others when they are stuck,
* interpersonal conflict between contributors.

Method:
