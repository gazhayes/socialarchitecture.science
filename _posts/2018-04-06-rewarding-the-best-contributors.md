Getting incentives right is very difficult, and maybe it's tall poppy syndrome kicking in but one feels a pang of unearned privilege when trying to create them.

Nevertheless, I decided to offer a monetary reward in appreciation of the best contributor of the fortnight at Blockrazor.

**Hypothesis:**

Offering a reward for the contributor who best follows the C4 and other contributor guidelines should increase the overall effort that contributors put into following these processes.
